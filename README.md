Recommendations
- The marketing team should increase their marketing campaign and advertisment in other states and also consider expanding into other countries. They could also provide discount on products.
- The management can examine the sales or marketing skills that the best manager posses and sensitize others about it. They could even introduce weekly or monthly commission to managers once sales target is meet or exceeded.
